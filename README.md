# GenAI-Powered Linux Command Automation

## Overview  
This project integrates Generative AI with Linux operations (GenAI + Ops). It allows users to enter natural language instructions, which are then converted into executable Linux commands. The script executes these commands and returns the results, making Linux operations more efficient and user-friendly.

## Features  
- Converts natural language into shell commands.  
- Executes system-level operations such as file management, process monitoring, and configuration.  
- Reduces repetitive manual typing and minimizes errors.  
- Demonstrates the practical use of AI in DevOps environments.
